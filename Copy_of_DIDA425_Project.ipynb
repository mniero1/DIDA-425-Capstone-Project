        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "For this project, we set out to investigate a topic relevant to students, educators, and policymakers alike: Does participation in organized sports during youth, high school and college affect academic performance? Our goal was to collect original survey data from college students (with a Binghamton focus) to examine the relationship between athletic involvement. This included training intensity, leadership roles, and NCAA participation—and academic outcomes measured by GPA. We hypothesized that sports participation might influence academic performance and acceptance into Binghamton itself through various factors: time management skills developed through balancing athletics and academics, institutional support structures available to student-athletes, or alternatively, the competing time demands that might detract from academic focus.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike many research projects that utilize existing datasets, we designed and implemented our own survey from scratch, aiming to collect responses from college students primarily at Binghamton University. Our survey instrument was designed to capture comprehensive information about respondents' sports participation history (ages 5-12 and 13-18), high school and college athletic involvement, training intensity, leadership positions, club participation, study habits, and self-reported GPAs. The dataset includes 36 variables covering demographic information, geographic origin, sports participation patterns, academic performance measures, and college athletic status. We distributed the survey through multiple channels including personal networks, department chairs, and social media during September-October 2025.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our approach involved using linear regression analysis to examine how various sports-related predictors (training frequency, number of sports played, leadership positions, NCAA athlete status) relate to academic outcomes while controlling for other factors such as study time, club involvement, and year in school. We planned to conduct separate analyses for high school GPA and college GPA, as well as year-specific models to determine whether the relationship between sports and academics changes as students progress through their college careers. Additionally, we aimed to compare academic performance between current NCAA athletes and non-athletes, and between students who played sports in high school versus those who did not.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project serves as an attempt of a comprehensive case study in survey research methodology, illustrating the complete process from research question formulation through data collection, cleaning, and analysis."

        "## Research Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Does sports participation during high school (ages 13-18) have a measurable effect on high school academic performance (GPA), and is this relationship mediated by factors such as training intensity, leadership roles, or club participation?\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Does high school sports participation have lasting effects on college academic performance, or does the relationship between athletics and academics change once students transition to higher education? Do students who played sports in high school perform differently in college compared to those who did not, controlling for high school GPA?\n",
        "\n",
        "3. How does current NCAA athletic participation in college affect academic performance? Do college athletes maintain similar, higher, or lower GPAs compared to non-athletes when controlling for high school academic performance and sports background? Does this relationship vary by year in school (sophomore, junior, senior)?\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the relationship between training intensity (days per week, hours per day) and academic outcomes? Is there a threshold where increased athletic commitment begins to negatively impact grades, or do student-athletes demonstrate better time management that allows them to maintain academic performance despite heavy training schedules?\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Beyond simple participation, do leadership positions in sports (team captain, etc.) correlate with higher academic achievement? Does the development of leadership skills through athletics translate into academic success, or are leadership roles simply markers of already high-achieving students?\n",
        "\n",
        "6. How do these relationships differ across various sports? Are there meaningful differences in academic outcomes between individual sports (track and field, swimming, tennis) versus team sports (basketball, soccer, volleyball), or between different levels of athletic commitment and competition intensity?"

        "\n",
        "At this point in our analysis, we consulted with our professor and recognized that our data contained fundamental biases stemming from flawed sampling methods. These methodological issues resulted in statistical models with few significant findings and compromised our ability to draw valid conclusions about our original research question. Warning signs had emerged earlier in our process: our representativeness calculations revealed severe underrepresentation of minoritized groups, dramatic overrepresentation of athletes (particularly track and field), and imbalanced coverage across demographic categories. Our sample reflected our personal networks rather than the target population we sought to study.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rather than forcing conclusions from fundamentally flawed data, we made the decision to pivot our project's focus. We redirected our efforts toward constructing a comprehensive methodological toolkit that future DIDA students can use to avoid similar pitfalls. This toolkit addresses the full research process, from initial question formulation through data collection and analysis, providing practical resources for students whether their projects require primary data collection through surveys or utilize existing datasets. Our goal shifted from answering a specific research question about sports and academics to creating lasting value for the student research community by documenting what went wrong, why it went wrong, and how to prevent these errors in future projects."
