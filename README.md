# Youth Sports Participation and Academic Performance Study

## Project Overview

This repository contains the complete research materials from our investigation into the relationship between youth sports participation and academic performance among undergraduate students. The project began as a traditional empirical analysis but evolved into something more valuable: a comprehensive toolkit to help future students avoid the pitfalls we encountered.

## Repository Contents

### Data Files
- **`YouthSportsTest.csv`** - Raw survey responses from over 200 undergraduate students (population: ~14,000)
- **`data.csv`** - Processed data with duplicates removed, missing values handled, and variables standardized

### Cleaning and Regression ipynb
- **`Copy_of_DIDA425_Project.ipynb`** - Python file containing:
  - Data cleaning procedure
  - Population calculations in correspondance to demographics to view biases
  - Multiple regression models

### Visualizations in R
- **`Project_Test_Visualization.Rmd`** - R file generating:
  - Demographic distribution plots
  - Correlation matrices
  - Box plots comparing sports vs. non-sports participants
  - Scatter plots examining GPA relationships

## Key Findings: What We Learned About Research Design

While our initial goal was to establish a relationship between sports participation and academic outcomes particularly at Binghamton University, our most significant findings were methodological rather than substantive. Through this project, we identified three critical biases that compromised our conclusions:

1. **Representational Bias**: Our 200-person sample represented only 1.4% of the undergraduate population—well below the recommended 4-5% threshold for reliable inference.

2. **Measurement Bias**: High school GPA proved to be an unreliable measure due to missing values, vast differences in grading standards, scales, and rigor across different schools.

3. **Learning Bias**: Our binary categorization of sports participation (played vs. didn't play) oversimplified a complex, multidimensional experience that varies by sport type, competition level, time commitment, and duration.

## The Pivot: From Research Project to Educational Resource

After completing our analysis and recognizing these fundamental limitations, we realized our struggles represented a common experience for students conducting survey research. Rather than simply documenting our findings and discussing inaccurate and biased results, we decided to transform our challenges into a learning opportunity for future students.

**This led us to develop a comprehensive web-based toolkit** that includes:
- Interactive flowcharts mapping the entire research process of a Data Analysis project highlighting the stage of Survey contruction and distribution
- Google form that mirrors flowchart that serves as a virtuyal assistant during the steps of the project
- Real examples from our project showing what went wrong and why
- Best practices for survey design, sampling, and statistical analysis

## Why This Matters

Most student research projects focus solely on presenting results. By openly documenting our methodological mistakes and the lessons learned, we hope to help future Digital and Data Studies Students (DIDA):
- Identify design flaws during the planning phase rather than after data collection
- Make informed decisions about sampling strategies and measurement choices
- Understand the real-world constraints that affect research quality
- Develop realistic project scopes that balance ambition with feasibility


## From Failure to Framework

This project embodies a crucial lesson in research: sometimes the most valuable outcome isn't confirming your hypothesis—it's understanding why your methodology fell short and using that knowledge to help others succeed. Our pivot from research project to educational toolkit represents our commitment to making data analysis more accessible, transparent, and ultimately more rigorous for future student researchers.

**Note**: While our original research question remained unanswered due to methodological limitations, the framework we developed ensures that future students will be better equipped to design studies that can actually answer their questions reliably.
